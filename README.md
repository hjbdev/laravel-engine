# Laravel Engine

[Documentation](https://engine.hjb.dev)

Supercharging your forms.

Declare the fields in your model, have the backend handle conditional logic, validation and form structure. All you have to do is loop through and display some fields. Let Engine handle the rest.

Designed to be used with reactive JS frameworks.

## Why?

The amount of times I've spun up a new project, only to be faced with a few hours of getting the boring, basic CRUD operations out of the way is more than I can count. It kinda sucks.

Originally I got the idea from seeing the documentation to Laravel Nova and its beautiful syntax for declaring fields.

Then, I got a bit carried away and wanted to see if I could get the frontend to live update the form's structure, based on validation from the backend.

The live update layer is completely optional. You're free to do an initial load to retrieve the structure and just use that.
